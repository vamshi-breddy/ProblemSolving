Example 1:

Input: intervals=[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,6]
 intervals.

Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]

Output: [[1,5]]

Explanation: Since intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,5].
