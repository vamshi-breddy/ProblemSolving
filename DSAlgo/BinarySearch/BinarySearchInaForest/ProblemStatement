There are n trees in a forest.
The heights of the trees is stored in array tree[], where tree[i] denotes the height of the ith tree in the forest.
If the ith tree is cut at a height H, then the wood collected is tree[i] - H, provided tree[i] > H.
If the total woods that needs to be collected is exactly equal to k,
find the height H at which every tree should be cut (all trees have to be cut at the same height).
If it is not possible then return -1 else return H.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5, k = 4
tree[] = {2, 3, 6, 2, 4}
Output: 3
Explanation: Wood collected by cutting trees
at height 3 = 0 + 0 + (6-3) + 0 + (4-3) = 4
hence 3 is to be subtracted from all numbers.
Since 2 is lesser than 3, nothing gets
subtracted from it.
