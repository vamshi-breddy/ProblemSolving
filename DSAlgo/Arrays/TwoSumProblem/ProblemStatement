Problem Statement: Given an array of integers nums[] and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such
that their sum is equal to the target.

Note: Assume that there is exactly one solution, and you are not allowed to use the same element twice.
Example: If target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9,
which is the required target, we return
indexes [0,1]. (0-based indexing)
Example 2:

Input Format: nums = [3,2,4,6], target = 6

Output: [1,2]

Explanation: Because nums[1] + nums[2] == 6,
which is the required target, we return
indexes [1,2].
